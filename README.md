# Fraud Detection

This repository showcases fraud detection using machine learning algorithms. The project aims to develop models for accurately identifying fraudulent transactions and activities.

## Dataset

The notebook uses a synthetic financial dataset for fraud detection. The dataset contains information about financial transactions and is designed specifically for fraud detection purposes.

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1/data).

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection. By detecting fraud, organizations can prevent financial losses, protect customers, and maintain system integrity.

## Results

The notebook demonstrates the following:

- Data Cleaning: The dataset is prepared by handling missing values and ensuring data quality.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations and statistical analysis provide insights into the dataset's characteristics.

- Model Building and Evaluation: Several machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated for fraud detection. Performance metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC score, and classification reports are provided.

- Leading AUC Score: The Random Forest model achieved an AUC score of 0.9, indicating its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.
